# PyBird-Shapefit
This is a repository for implementing the Shapefit algorithm into Pybird. Run pybird-desi_new/fitting_codes/fit_UNIT_pybird_template.py to get the Shapefit and BAO parameters, then run pybird-desi_new/fitting_codes/convert_chain_shapefit.py to convert the Shapefit and BAO parameters to the cosmological parameters. To run a full-shape fit, run pybird-desi_new/fitting_codes/fit_KP4_pybird.py.
